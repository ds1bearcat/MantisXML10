CSRF code has been included in the code for MANTIS. However, it is turned OFF by default. Follow these steps to turn CSRF functionality on:

1)	In the web.xml located in the WEB-INF folder, add the following sections:
    <filter>
        <filter-name>CSRFPreventionFilter</filter-name>
        <filter-class>
			com.cincom.MantisWeb.MantisCsrfPreventionFilter
        </filter-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>entryPoints</param-name>
            <param-value>/index.jsp,/start.jsp</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>nonceCacheSize</param-name>
            <param-value>100</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>denyStatus</param-name>
            <param-value>403</param-value>
        </init-param>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>CSRFPreventionFilter</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
        <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
        <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
	</filter-mapping>

2) You must re-compile the Java classes in this project. This is located in the <webapp folder>\src\com\cincom\MantisWeb folder.
	This contains instructions in a "TODO BEFORE COMPILE.txt" file which you need to follow in order to compile the classes correctly with the CSRF.


NOTES FOR INSTALLER:
a) the "entryPoints" parameter in Step 1 is where you define the starting page that the user must go through in order to have the nonce generated. 
start.jsp and index.jsp are provided as samples for what the page should contain to redirect to the correct start login page. You can call the page(s) whatever you want.
The pages need to be .jsp pages (java server pages) and contain the basic functionality as defined in the samples provided.

b) web.csrf.xml is a sample file provided for you to turn on CSRF functionality. This is located in the WEB-INF folder under the web root.

c) To test whether this is working, go directly to the Start login page. You should get a 403 error message.
The means of getting to the Start Login page correctly is to go through the 'entrypoint' pages defined above.

d) There are 2 entry point pages provided as samples for you. You can create 1 or multiple entrypoints for getting to your site.
	i) start.jsp - automatically redirects the user to the Start login screen after 200 milliseconds
	ii) index.jsp - displays a page with a link on it to the Start login screen that needs to be clicked by the user
