In order to get the java files to compile, the tomcat-juli.jar must be included in order to build the project.

Here are the steps to add this jar file into the project:

1) Go to the top menu bar and click on "Project"
2) Then click on "Properties"
3) Select the "Java Build Path"
4) Click on the "Libraries" tab on the top
5) Click the "Add External Jars" button on the right
6) Find the tomcat-juli.jar file on the file system. It should be in the "<tomcat install folder>\bin" directory
	This should add the tomcat-juli.jar file into the listing box on this screen.
7) Hit the "Apply" button or the "OK" button to proceed

Now you should be able to build the java files into the class files.
